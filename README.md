Took a long vacation, no makeup, just Jay-Z
You were balls deep, now we beefin', had me butt-naked at the MGM
So wasted screamin', "Fuck that," love me now, but I'm anythin'
Hurry now, baby, stick it in 'fore the memories get to kickin' in

It's too late, I don't wanna lose what's left of you

How am I supposed to tell ya?
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (do)

You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do
You do, nobody gets me, you do

Took me out to the ballet
You proposеd, I went on the road
You was feelin' empty, so you lеft me
Now I'm stuck dealin' with a deadbeat

If I'm real, I deserve less
If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man, it's you
And I know that it's too late

I don't wanna lose what's left of you

How am I supposed to tell ya?
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (do)

You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do, ooh)
You do, nobody gets me, you do (do, ooh)
Nobody gets me, you do
